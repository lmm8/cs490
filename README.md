Objective: Create an online exam system, think CS 100, where the language you are testing is python, open ended questions.
Imagine they are writing a sample python program on the test.

---4 USE CASES---
1)Instructor logs in and adds questions to the question bank

2)Instructor can select questions from a question bank to make up an exam

3) Student can log in and take the exam
	-every question is going to be of the form, write a function named(), uses argumets (), does this(), and returns this()

Exam should be graded by your script, then grade can be adjusted by instructor. Expect a sample answer, like:
def operation(op,a,b):
	if op == '+':
		return a+b
	elif op == '-':
		return a-b
	elif op == '*':
		return a*b
	elif op == '/':
		return a/b
	else:
		return "error"

4)Student can view the results
